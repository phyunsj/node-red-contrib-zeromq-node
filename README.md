# Create Custome Node for Node-RED

Demonstrating how to write custom nodes for **Node-RED** (Related Link :  https://nodered.org/docs/creating-nodes/)

## Node-RED 

Node-RED is a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services in new and interesting ways. It provides a browser-based editor that makes it easy to wire together flows using the wide range of nodes in the palette that can be deployed to its runtime in a single-click. _from https://nodered.org/_

## Example : ZeroMQ (ØMQ) Node + Node-RED-Dashbaord
